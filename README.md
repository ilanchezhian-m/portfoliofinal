## Introduction

As a web developer, I love crafting digital experiences that are not only visually appealing but also functional and user-friendly. In this portfolio, you will find projects that showcase my proficiency in using **Qwik** as the main framework, along with the integration of **Tailwind CSS** and **React** to create dynamic and responsive web applications. Additionally, I have employed **TypeScript** to bring type safety and enhanced development capabilities to the projects.

## Technologies Used

I have employed a powerful combination of technologies to build these projects, enabling seamless and efficient development:

- **Qwik**: A modern and efficient web framework that streamlines the development process.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework that provides high customization and rapid styling capabilities.
- **React**: A popular JavaScript library for building interactive user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: A strongly-typed superset of JavaScript that enhances code quality and maintainability.
